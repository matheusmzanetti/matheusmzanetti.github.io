Hello, I'm a Ph.D. student in the Department of Political Science at Florida State University.

Before starting my doctoral program at FSU, I earned a master’s degree in law, a law degree, and a degree in International Relations from Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais (PUC Minas), Brazil.

I study judicial politics and political behavior, focusing on:
- how judges’ individual characteristics shape judicial decision-making;
- descriptive representation in judging and how the public perceives judges’ identities;
- public opinion about courts and how citizens respond to institutional symbols; 
- judicial elections.

Feel free to contact me at mmoreirazanetti@fsu.edu
