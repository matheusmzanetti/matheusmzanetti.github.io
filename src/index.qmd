Hello, I'm a Ph.D. student in the Department of Political Science at Florida State University.

Before starting my doctoral program at FSU, I earned a master’s degree in law, a law degree, and a degree in International Relations from Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais (PUC Minas), Brazil.

I study judicial politics and political behavior, focusing on:
<ul>
  <li>how judges’ individual characteristics shape judicial decision-making;</li>
  <li>descriptive representation in judging and how the public perceives judges’ identities;</li>
  <li>public opinion about courts and how citizens respond to institutional symbols;</li>
  <li>judicial elections.</li>
</ul>

Feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:mmoreirazanetti@fsu.edu">mmoreirazanetti@fsu.edu</a>.
